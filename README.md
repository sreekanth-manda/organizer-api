# organizer

This is a REST API developed using python-flask module.

This is used to organize tasks, add reminders, etc for day-to-day tasks. A frontend will be provided using a javascript framework like Angular
or React at a later stage.

This inital version is a very basic app with create, update, edit and delete the tasks. Tasks are maintained in memory and will be destroyed
on exit of the application.
